# Iris recognition designed for post-mortem and diseased eyes

This software package demonstrates how to combine selected efforts aimed at delivering effective iris recognition methods for diseased eyes and post-mortem samples (collected after death). The following codes and models were merged here into a complete iris recognition software package:

a) segmentation and normalization:
